  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in LinkÃ¶ping, Sweden. As a kid I was the one who went home and the first thing she did was her maths homework; I've always enjoyed studying mathematics. It's beautiful, confusing and weird (it doesn't get better than that!). I didn't find high school physics particularly interesting; however, after watching the documentary Particle fever about the Higgs particle, I started to get curious about the physics path. I obtained a short-term traineeship at CERN during my second year of high school and decided to study physics for my bachelor's at Stockholm University. Studying both physics and mathematics, I quickly noticed I enjoyed the "pure" mathematics (number theory, combinatorics, group theory etc) more than the typical "physics-maths" ones. Being hopeful I could combine my favourite mathematical areas with my love for describing the physical universe, I started taking extra maths modules to introduce me to mathematical physics. For my master's, I chose perhaps one of the most mathematical programs in the world: <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/prospective.html">Part III of the Mathematical Tripos</a> at the University of Cambridge. Described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_III_of_the_Mathematical_Tripos">"one of the hardest and most intensive mathematics courses in the world"</a> (we'll see during exam season...). So far, I've studied QFT, GR, Symmetries (Lie groups and algebras) and will cover String Theory, the Standard Model and Supersymmetry by the end of the program. These are great topics for someone like me, and I'm excited to learn more about them! Besides mathematics and physics, I enjoy dancing (in particular Jazz/Showdance) and getting heavily invested in TV shows (my top three are Black Mirror, BBC Sherlock and Dirk Gently!).</p>

        <li>I did at least one show every term. My favourite was a play-off of the "Orange is the new black." I was more into chemistry here as it involed more maths at the time. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>When I learnt the *real* basic mathematics. Simple life. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    I took a gap-year between high school and my undergrad. I taught mathematics and physics at my old schools (Kivnnebyskolan and Katedralskolan) and worked with my non-profit organisation <a href="https://girlsinstem.se">Girls in STEM</a>. For me, it was a very valuable year as I was not sure if should do engineering or physics before, but teaching made me realise I was more into "pure" physics than applied. Moreover, from a personal perspective I think it made me grow as a person and I felt very ready to embark on my academic journey after. Would recommend!

   <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in Newtownabbey, a suburb of the city of Belfast. As a child, I loved palaeontology; I knew the names of dinosaurs, what they ate, the length of their tails etc. Who could ever have predicted that one day I really would be digging up fossils - QCD papers from the 80s (and like real fossils, they can teach you a lot about the present). Eventually this led to a fascination with space (what killed the dinosaurs?) and eventually to physics. Eventually I tore through physics magazines (quite literally tore one to shreds on holiday) and books and learnt about all the funny little unsolved problems in physics. <br>
<br>
In high-school I enjoyed Physics and Further Maths (like normal Maths but they taught matrices). Once Maths started to get away from compound interest and quadratic equations, I started to appreciate it more and started to really enjoy reading about its uses in physics. I did an Integrated Master‚Äôs at The University of Manchester focusing on Theoretical Physics and in my first year was told about ‚ÄúGauge Theories‚Äù by my Advanced Dynamics professor. I thought that sounded interesting so I followed that path (including of course QFT) and eventually did Gauge Theories in my final semester and loved it. <br>
<br>
I did an internship at the University of Graz, studying the Monte Carlo simulations of semi-visible jets, with Dr. Suchita Kulkarni. Eventually, this evolved into the PhD that I started in February of this year. I‚Äôm very much interested in many aspects of Beyond the Standard Model physics, especially the model-building of dark matter, but I‚Äôm always interesting in different areas too (cosmology, supersymmetry etc). <br>
<br>
Besides physics, I love to go for long walks and hikes, play spikeball (Graz people will understand),  and visit museums/art galleries. I also love to watch TV (Twin Peaks, Better Call Saul and Killing Eve to name a few). When I‚Äôm too lazy to hike, I like to build things in Minecraft; currently I am building a canal bisecting two mountains. </p>

  <p>I like to travel when I have the time (or salary). Here are some photos of nice places I have been:</p>
